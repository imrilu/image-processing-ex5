A1: The residual blocks affected the learning performance by lowering the training error. With more residual blocks, the 
training error got smaller (generally speaking). although there is a slight anomaly when increasing residual blocks number 
on "denoising" learner - possibly due to overffiting of the data. In terms of the image output, image quality is better with each
increase in the number of residual blocks.
