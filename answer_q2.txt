A2: the workflow could work for super resolution in the following way: we will create our 
training set using high-res pictures that will be fed to the learner in batches of random 
patches, along with the corresponding corrupted version of them. The corruption function will 
take a picture in high-res and lower it's res (using pyramids or other methods we've seen in class).
restore_image function will work exactly the same way, but the size of the picture (input of model) 
will now be high-res.
